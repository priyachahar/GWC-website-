      <p> One of the best forms of healing: looking at stars. When gazing at glittering balls of gas in the black nothingness of space, everything in my world seems so, so small. And I think that's beautiful. When you get caught up in the trivialities of day-to-day, looking at stars in the still, silent night puts a lot into perspective. Its hard to imagine just how big and brilliant the universe is - and its even harder to remain appreciative of our place in it. But hopefully, this page will get you a  little closer. There are no worries or troubles here,just breathe, empty your head and spend a while looking at the swirls and sparkles of space. </p>
